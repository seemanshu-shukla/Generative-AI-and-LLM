1. A useful example to illustrate these ideas is training a model to play Tic-Tac-Toe. Let's take a look. In this example, the agent is a model or policy acting as a Tic-Tac-Toe player. Its objective is to win the game. The environment is the three by three game board, and the state at any moment, is the current configuration of the board. The action space comprises all the possible positions a player can choose based on the current board state. The agent makes decisions by following a strategy known as the RL policy. Now, as the agent takes actions, it collects rewards based on the actions' effectiveness in progressing towards a win. The goal of reinforcement learning is for the agent to learn the optimal policy for a given environment that maximizes their rewards. This learning process is iterative and involves trial and error. Initially, the agent takes a random action which leads to a new state. From this state, the agent proceeds to explore subsequent states through further actions. The series of actions and corresponding states form a playout, often called a rollout.

2. Now let's take a look at how the Tic-Tac-Toe example can be extended to the case of fine-tuning large language models with RLHF. In this case, the agent's policy that guides the actions is the LLM, and its objective is to generate text that is perceived as being aligned with the human preferences. This could mean that the text is, for example, helpful, accurate, and non-toxic. The environment is the context window of the model, the space in which text can be entered via a prompt. The state that the model considers before taking an action is the current context. That means any text currently contained in the context window. The action here is the act of generating text. This could be a single word, a sentence, or a longer form text, depending on the task specified by the user. The action space is the token vocabulary, meaning all the possible tokens that the model can choose from to generate the completion. How an LLM decides to generate the next token in a sequence, depends on the statistical representation of language that it learned during its training. At any given moment, the action that the model will take, meaning which token it will choose next, depends on the prompt text in the context and the probability distribution over the vocabulary space. The reward is assigned based on how closely the completions align with human preferences. Given the variation in human responses to language, determining the reward is more complicated than in the Tic-Tac-Toe example. One way you can do this is to have a human evaluate all of the completions of the model against some alignment metric, such as determining whether the generated text is toxic or non-toxic. This feedback can be represented as a scalar value, either a zero or a one. The LLM weights are then updated iteratively to maximize the reward obtained from the human classifier, enabling the model to generate non-toxic completions. However, obtaining human feedback can be time consuming and expensive. As a practical and scalable alternative, you can use an additional model, known as the reward model, to classify the outputs of the LLM and evaluate the degree of alignment with human preferences. You'll start with a smaller number of human examples to train the secondary model by your traditional supervised learning methods. Once trained, you'll use the reward model to assess the output of the LLM and assign a reward value, which in turn gets used to update the weights off the LLM and train a new human aligned version. Exactly how the weights get updated as the model completions are assessed, depends on the algorithm used to optimize the policy. You'll explore these issues in more depth shortly. Lastly, note that in the context of language modeling, the sequence of actions and states is called a rollout, instead of the term playout that's used in classic reinforcement learning. The reward model is the central component of the reinforcement learning process. It encodes all of the preferences that have been learned from human feedback, and it plays a central role in how the model updates its weights over many iterations.

3. The second part of the process performs reinforcement learning. This stage is similar to RLHF, except that instead of human feedback, we now use feedback generated by a model. This is sometimes referred to as reinforcement learning from AI feedback or RLAIF. Here you use the fine-tuned model from the previous step to generate a set of responses to your prompt. You then ask the model which of the responses is preferred according to the constitutional principles. The result is a model generated preference dataset that you can use to train a reward model. With this reward model, you can now fine-tune your model further using a reinforcement learning algorithm like PPO, as discussed earlier. Aligning models is a very important topic and an active area of research.

4. Below are some of the questions that we need to ask in the final stage where we are looking to integrate our LLM model to the application(Web/Desktop) to convert into LLM based application:

FIRST SET OF QUESTION alinged to how your LLM will function in deployment:
--> So how fast do you need your model to generate completions?

--> What compute budget do you have available? And are you willing to trade off model performance for improved inference speed or lower storage?

SECOND SET OF QUESTION allinged to additional resources that your model may need:
--> Do you intend for your model to interact with external data or other applications?
--> And if so, how will you connect to those resources?

LAST SET OF QUESTION is alligned to how the model is going to be consumed:
--> What will the intended application or API interface that your model will be consumed through look like?
